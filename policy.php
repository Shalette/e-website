All the chat/messaging logs or call recordings can be used to but not limited to monitor and prohibit abuse, safeguard the rights of consumers and service professionals, resolve disputes. If we deem it necessary, in our sole and absolute discretion, we may also ask for and collect supplemental information from third parties, such as information about your credit from a credit bureau (to the extent permitted by law), or information to verify any identification details you provide during registration.</p>

    <br><h5><b>2. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES</b></h5>
    <p>You may log into our Website through your Facebook account. If you do so, you must enter the email address and password that you use for your Facebook account. We will ask that you grant us permission to access and collect your Facebook basic information (this includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, date of birth, email address, and any other information you have set to public on your Facebook account).

For information about how Facebook may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult Facebook’s privacy policy. We have no control over how any third party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you. </p>

    <br><h5><b>3. COLLECTION OF AUTOMATIC INFORMATION, USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING DEVICES</b></h5>
    <p>We and our third party service providers, which include ad networks, use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our Website and Services, such as your browser type, your ISP or operating system, your domain name, your access time, the URL of the previous website you visited, your page views, your IP address, and the type of device that you use. We also track how frequently you visit our Website and use our Services. We use this information (including the information collected by our third party service providers) for Website analytics (including to determine which portions of our Website are used most frequently, what our users like/do not like), to assist us in determining relevant advertising (both on and off our Website), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this policy. Currently, we do not honour browser requests not to be tracked. We may obtain your device ID, which is sent to Selectiall’s servers and used in fraud prevention efforts. Cookies. We and our third party service providers collect information from you by using cookies. A cookie is a small file stored on user’s computer hard drive containing information about the user. The cookie helps us analyze web traffic or informs you about your use of a particular website. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual, tailoring its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. When you visit the Website, we may send one or more cookies (i.e., a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your computer that identifies your browser. Some of these cookies may be connected to third-party companies or websites. The terms of use of such cookies are governed by this Policy and the privacy policy of the relevant third party company or website. For example, Google measures the performance of advertisements by placing cookies on your computer when you click on ads. If you visit the Website when you have such cookies on your computer, we and Google will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google. The terms of use of these cookies are governed by this Policy and Google’s Privacy Policy. Disabling Cookies. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Website because it may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Website usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>

    <br><h5><b>4. HOW PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED</b></h5>
    <p>We collect your personal information and aggregate information about the use of our Website and Services to better understand your needs and to provide you with a better Website experience. Specifically, we may use your personal information for any of the following reasons:
      <ul>
        <li> To provide our Services to you, including registering you for our Services, verifying your identity and authority to use our Services, and to otherwise enable you to use our Website and our Services</li>

        <li> To contact you via email, telephone, facsimile or mail, or, where requested, by text message, to deliver certain services or information you have requested</li>
        <li>For Selectiall’s market research purposes, including, but not limited to, the customization of the Website according to your interests</li>
        <li>We may use your demographic information (i.e., age, postal code, residential and commercial addresses, and other various data) to more effectively facilitate the promotion of goods and services to appropriate target audiences and for other research and analytical purposes</li>
        <li>To resolve disputes, to protect ourselves and other users of our Website and Services, and to enforce our Terms of Use</li>
        <li>We also may compare personal information collected through the Website and Services to verify its accuracy with personal information collected from third parties</li>
        <li>We may combine aggregate data with the personal information we collect about you</li>
        <li>From time to time, Selectiall may use personal information for new and unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy.

      </p>

    <br><h5><b>5. ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS, INVITATIONS, POLLS AND SURVEYS</b></h5>
    <p>At our sole discretion, Selectiall may offer any of the following free services on the Website, which you may select to use or receive at your option. Certain of the following services may require you to provide additional personal information as detailed below:</p>
    <b>1. ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS</b>
    <p>We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users. We will gather the email addresses of users who sign up for Selectiall for the newsletter mailing list. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by opting out of receiving newsletters during the registration process, by following the link provided in each newsletter that points users to a subscription management page where the user can unsubscribe from receiving newsletters or by changing their preferences in their Profile Settings page.</p>
    <b>2. “SEND TO A FRIEND”</b>
    <p>Our Website users can voluntarily choose to electronically forward a link, page, or document to someone else by clicking “send to a friend.” To do so, the user must provide his or her email address, as well as the email address of the recipient. The user’s email address is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
    <b>3. POLLING</b>
    <p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues, Services, and/or the Website. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. We may use a system to “tag” users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
    <b>4. SURVEYS</b>
    <p>We may conduct user surveys from time to time to better target our content to our Website users. We will not share individual responses from these surveys with any third party. We will share aggregate data with third party service providers, partners, and other third parties. We also will post aggregate data containing survey responses on our Website; that data may be viewed and downloaded by other users of our Website.</p>
    <b>5. SECURITY</b>
    <p>We employ procedural and technological security measures, which are reasonably designed to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Selectiall may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100% complete. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will not be collected and used by others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. Selectiall is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information or for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.</p>
    <b>6. DISCLOSURE</b>
    <p>We may share the information that we collect about you, including your personal information, as follows:
      <ol type="1">
        <li><h6><b>INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO PROTECT US AND OTHERS</b></h6>

        <ul><li> Selectiall reasonably believes that disclosure is necessary in order to comply with a legal process (such as a court order, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirement of any governmental authority</li>
          <li> disclosure would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit</li>
          <li> reasonably necessary to enforce this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use etc.</li>
          <li> disclosure is intended to help investigate or prevent unauthorized transactions or other illegal activities</li>
          <li> necessary or appropriate to protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of any person or entity.</li></ul>
        </li>

        <li><h6><b>INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS</b></h6>
        We may contract with various third parties for the provision and maintenance of the Website, Services and our business operations, and Selectiall may need to share your personal information and data generated by cookies and aggregate information (collectively, “information”) with these vendors and service agencies. For example, we may provide your information to a credit card processing company to process your payment. The vendors and service agencies will not receive any right to use your personal information beyond what is necessary to perform its obligations to provide the Services to you. If you complete a survey, we also may share your information with the survey provider; if we offer a survey in conjunction with another entity, we also will disclose the results to that entity.</li>
        <li><h6><b>DISCLOSURE TO NON-AFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES IN FURTHERANCE OF YOUR REQUEST</b></h6>
        Your request for services may be shared with third party websites with whom we have a contractual relationship in order to provide your request with maximum exposure. The post on the third party website will include the details of your request, including your location, and other contact details. Interested bidders, however, will be able to click on your request on such third party site, and will be directed to our Website where they will have access to your contact details (Partial or complete), as would any other service provider on our Website interested in bidding on your request.</li>
        <li><h6><b>DISCLOSURE TO OTHER USERS OF OUR WEBSITE</b></h6>
        If you are a Service Professional, the information that you post (other than your payment information) is available to other users of our Website and our Services. Comments that users post to our Website also will be available to other visitors to our Website (see our discussion of User Generated Content below). In addition, we will post the results (in aggregate form) of surveys to our Website. If you are a consumer, name, and location, as well as the details of your request, are available to all visitors to our Website. Bidding professionals also will be permitted to see the consumer’s full name, telephone number, email address and the location</li>
        <li><h6><b>INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS</b></h6>
        We will disclose your information, including, without limitation, your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, user ID history, quoting and listing history, and fraud complaints, to law enforcement or other government officials if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an investigation of a governmental authority.</li>
        <li><h6><b>IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR BANKRUPTCY</b></h6>
        In the event that Selectiall undergoes a change in control, including, without limitation, a merger or sale of all or substantially all of Selectiall’s assets to which this Website relates or other corporate reorganization in which Selectiall participates, and is thus merged with or acquired by a third party entity (a “Successor”), Selectiall hereby reserves the right to transfer the information we have collected from the users of the Website and/or Services to such Successor. In addition, in the event of Selectiall’s bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application or laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, Selectiall may not be able to control how your information is transferred, used, or treated and reserves the right to transfer the information we have collected from the users of the Website and/or Services to non-affiliated third parties in such event.</li>
        <li><h6><b>INFORMATION DISCLOSED AT YOUR REQUEST</b></h6>We may share your personal information with other Registered Users to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information or if you explicitly consent to such disclosure upon receipt of a specific Service. For instance, when you contract for a specific Service with another Registered User, Selectiall will send that Registered User a notice that includes the personal information that you have chosen to allow Selectiall to reveal to users with whom you contract.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <br><h5><b>Links to External Websites</b></h5>
    <p>The Website may contain links to other websites or resources over which Selectiall does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Selectiall of those external websites. You acknowledge that Selectiall is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Selectiall is not responsible for the content of such external websites. We are not responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such external websites and such sites are not governed by this Policy. Your use of any external website is subject to the terms of use and privacy policy located on the linked to external website.</p>

    <br><h5><b>Updating, Deleting and Correcting Your Personal Information</b></h5>
    <p>You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways: You can review, correct and delete your personal information by logging into the Website and navigating to your preferences page in “Edit Profile.” You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Typically, we will not manually alter your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. Nonetheless, upon your request we will close your Account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible based on your Account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take any other actions otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole and absolute discretion. You should understand, however, that once you publicly post a Request, Offer, Want, Feedback, or any other information onto the Website, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deleted or removed your Account, you agree that Selectiall shall not be responsible for any personal information that was not included within your deleted and/or removed Account that remains on the Website.</p>

    <br><h5><b>What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?</b></h5>
    <p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your Account or any Services you have requested or received from us.</p>

    <br><h5><b>Third-Party Ad Networks</b></h5>
    <p>We participate in third party ad networks that may display advertisements on other websites based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, and not by Selectiall’s Policy. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.</p>

    <br><h5><b>USE OF YOUR FULL NAME</b></h5>
    <p>As a Registered User of the Website you will select a Full Name during the registration process. All of your activities on the Website will be traceable to your Full Name. Certain other people, including other Registered Users with whom you have transacted business via the Website, can see a large part of your activity on the Website. If you book a service with a Registered User, cancel a scheduled service with a Registered User, receive an offer on your posted service from a Registered User, or have posted a service, Selectiall may send a notice to you or the appropriate Registered User that includes your Full Name. Thus, if you associate your real name with your Full Name, the people to whom you have revealed your name may be able to personally identify your Website activities.</p>

    <br><h5><b>USING INFORMATION FROM SELECTIALL</b></h5>
    <p>The Website facilitates your sharing of personal information with others in order to negotiate, provide, and use the Services. If you agree to contract for a service with another Registered User, you may need to reveal your name, email, phone number, or personal address to that individual so that the service may be performed. Please respect the privacy of others. You agree to use the information of other users solely for the following purposes:
      <ol type="a">
        <li> Selectiall-transaction-related purposes</li>
        <li> using Services offered through the Website.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <br><h5><b>ACCOUNT PROTECTION</b></h5>
    <p>Your password is the key to your Account. When creating your password you should use unique numbers, letters, special characters, and combinations thereof. In addition, DO NOT disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, you are solely responsible for all actions taken via your Account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Thus, IF YOUR PASSWORD HAS BEEN COMPROMISED FOR ANY REASON, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY SELECTIALL TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.</p>

    <br><h5><b>User Generated Content</b></h5>
    <p>We invite you to post content on our Website, including your comments, feedback, pictures, and any other information that you would like to be available on our Website. If you post content to our Website, all of the information that you post will be available to all visitors to our Website. If you post your own content on our Website or Services, your posting may become public and Selectiall cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.</p>
